# JavaChatApp 🚀

A simple **Java Chat Application (Server + Client)** built with Java’s socket programming.  
This project is a *work in progress* — updated daily as I learn and improve real‑time networking in Java. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

---

## 🧠 About

This repository contains a basic implementation of a chat application using `ServerSocket` and `Socket` in Java.  
It allows a client to connect to a server and send messages. My goal with this project is to gradually build it into a fully functional multi‑client chat system. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## 💡 Features (Work in Progress)

✔️ Server and client with basic message sending  
✔️ Plain text communication over sockets  
❌ Multi‑client support (coming soon)  
❌ GUI interface  
❌ Message broadcast to all clients

Feel free to follow along or contribute! :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## ▶️ How to Run

### Run the Server

1. Compile the server:
   ```bash
   javac ChatServer.java
Run it:

-- java ChatServer
Run the Client
Compile the client:

-- ChatClient.java
Run it:
java ChatClient
Now type messages in the client console to send them to the server.


## 📈 Future Improvements
-- ✔️ Add support for handling multiple clients
